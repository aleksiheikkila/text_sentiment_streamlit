# Simple text sentiment app done using Streamlit

Works as a brief test / intro to Streamlit, deployed to Heroku.

For the time being, the app can be accessed [on Heroku](https://text-sentiment-streamlit-app.herokuapp.com/)

Some notes:
- Heroku uses runtime.txt to infer which python version to use
- Heroku runs the Procfile upon start-up, which basically runs setup shell script and launches the streamlit app.
